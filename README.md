# Next-Word-Prediction-using-LSTM

A Next Word Predictor using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a natural language processing (NLP) application that aims to predict the most likely word or sequence of words that should come after a given input text. 

In this project, I have developed a Next Word Predictor using LSTM while working with a small text dataset. Despite the limited data, the goal remains the same: to generate coherent and contextually relevant predictions for the next word in a text sequence.
